Shortest path algorithms complexity analysis and application to route planning

Finding the shortest-path between two points is very important in route planning. Some of the most famous algorithms that solve this problem are Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford. In this work, we analyse their computational complexity and compare their execution time in different situations. Furthermore, we show the application of this kind of algorithm in a real world decision problem using data from a platform that provides free geographic data.
